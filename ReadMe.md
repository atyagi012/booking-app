#Concurrency in GO
- **GO use "Green thread"
- ** Abstraction of an actual thread
- ** Managed by the go runtime, we interact only with high level goroutines
- ** Cheaper & Lightweight
- ** Channels - Built-in functionality for goroutines to talk with one another
- ** Less start-up time and less overhead

#Run Code
- ** Clone the code
- ** Open project in VS Code
- ** Open terminal in VS Code
- ** Run command "go run ."
